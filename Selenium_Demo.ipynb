    "## Introduction to Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is Selenium?\n",
    "[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is a tool used to automate interactions with a web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the library's initial purpose was to automate web application testing, the functionality it offers is comprehensive enough to find use in almost any web scraping/interaction use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Selenium Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium simulates opening a web page in a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, IE). A developer may then interact with the web page in the way it would be displayed to a user/customer/etc browsing the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of interactions include (non-exhaustive):\n",
    "- Clicking on buttons\n",
    "- Executing JavaScript\n",
    "- Filling out embedded web forms\n",
    "- **Expanding drop-down menus**\n",
    "- **Scraping rendered HTML**\n",
    "- **Following hyperlinks to other pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this demo will be on the last three general uses.\n"

    "## Web Scraping Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "One should consider the effect of their web scraping use case on the websites to be scraped and the data to be collected: \n",
    "- Make sure the web scraper is not going to tax the server(s) of any target websites.\n",
    "    - Rapidly requesting resources (HTML, images, or other documents) from a site may strain the capabilities of their server and slow down (or even crash!) the website.\n",
    "    - This is more common for smaller sites with less resources available.\n",
    "- Only scrape data intended for the public. Try to avoid collecting personally identifiable information from sites unless given explicit permission for the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing **any** web scraping, check if the data you are looking to collect is available in a public database or API endpoint! \n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality and sohpistication of Selenium also makes it a very **heavy-weight** library for web scraping. Opening and simulating a browser incurs additional costs in time and resources that simpler web scraping implementations would avoid. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one only needs to retrieve data embedded in the HTML of *simple* web sites, they should see if the BeautifulSoup and URLLib/requests libraries alone would work for their use case. \n",
    "- This approach would simply retrieve the main DOM ([Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), basically the HTML and JavaScript) directly from a web server as a string for parsing in BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "- Skipping the overhead of first rendering a web page in a browser makes web scraping MUCH FASTER!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So, why even bother with Selenium for web scraping? \n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern websites have more sophisticated HTML/CSS/JavaScript that may render information in ways that cannot be accessed directly from the main DOM. For example: \n",
    "- Links from dropdown menus (or any HTML tag set to `[aria-expanded='false']`)\n",
    "- Data in [Iframes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp) (embedded web pages in another web page)\n",
    "- Dynamic text, or data that depends on the browser window size to appear\n",
    "\n",
    "Any interaction with elements on a web page will also require Selenium.  "

    "## Selenium Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the Selenium library into your environment. Run `conda env create -f selenium.yml` in the root of this repository to create such an environment.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install browser of choice. I am using Chrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install required web driver\n",
    "   - Selenium requires a web driver executable to use in simulating a browser.\n",
    "   - Managing the proper browser and webdriver versions is a pain! We can use webdriver_manager to install and use the correct driver for our browser version.\n",
    "   - *Note*: More recent versions of Selenium have a built-in 'selenium manager' that managese the driver for you behind the scenes. However, the functionality is a little finicky, so I am opting to use the webdriver_manager object in the demo to be more explicit."

It is a particular version of artificial neural networks that emphasizes learning representation with multiple layers of networks. Deep Learning, plus the specialized techniques that it has inspired (e.g. convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers), have led to rapid improvements in many applications, such as computer vision, machine learning, sound understanding, and robotics. This course gives students an overview of the prominent techniques of Deep Learning and its applications in computer vision, language understanding, and other areas. It also provides hands-on practice of implementing deep learning algorithms in Python. A final project will implement an advanced piece of work in one of these areas. Prerequisites: basic programming: (CSCI 0150, 0170, 0190); linear algebra: (CSCI 0530, MATH 0520, 0540); stats/probability: (CSCI 0220, 1450, 0450, MATH 1610, APMA 1650, 1655)',\n",
